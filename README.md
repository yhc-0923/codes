 -  drawfig.py: Containing the fuctions for drawing figures in the maintext of the paper.
 -  rawdata: The folder contains the unprocessed experimental rawdata.
 -  figures: The folder cantains the figures generated by the codes.

## Introduction of the Functions
 - cal_p: Calculating the frequencies and their statistical properties.
 - cal_delta: Estimating the result by the maximum likelihood estimation method and calculating the variance.
 - f_minimize: The function for manual fitting the probability density functions while scipy works bad. 
 - cal_FI: Calculating the classical fisher information from the fitting probability density functions.
 - cal_singularity: Shearching for the singularities.
 - data_analysis: the main function.
